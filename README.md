## Analysis Process
### 1. Data Cleaning & Validation
The initial phase focused on ensuring data integrity and consistency
### 2. Data Transformation
To prepare for visualization, the raw data was aggregated and restructured
* **Pivot Table Creation:** Built multiple tables to summarize customer counts.
### 3. Dashboard Development
The final stage involved building an interactive interface for data-driven insights:
* **Visualization Tools:** Developed Pivot Charts including Line Graphs for trends, Donut Charts for proportions, and KPI Cards for quick summaries.
* **Interactive Features:** Integrated **Slicers** for dynamic filtering by *Year*, *Month*, and *Occupation*.
* **Geospatial Mapping:** Implemented Map Visualizations to represent customer distribution geographically.
